This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About project and future plans

We want to build an organization to help India develop. We plan to create a rank-based system to manage this organization, where individuals who complete more tasks will attain higher ranks. These tasks may encompass activities such as cleaning, tree planting, and solar plant construction. I understand it's a significant dream, but with collective effort, we can accomplish it

## Future Plans
# 1. Machile Learning Model
  We will be utilizing machine learning to authenticate and detect images or videos to verify the completion of tasks.
# 2. Add Map
  Additionally, we plan to incorporate a map feature to showcase real-time progress of our work to the world. This map will continually update with both old and new images, providing a dynamic visual representation of our ongoing initiatives.
# 3. Add Shop
  We intend to introduce a dedicated shop where individuals can purchase equipment specifically designed for cleaning and planting purposes. These items will be distributed based on the respective ranks achieved by participants, creating a system that rewards and supports their commitment to our initiatives
# 4.Credit System
  We are considering implementing a credit system that allows individuals to earn money based on their ranks. Alternatively, participants may receive a minimum salary commensurate with the type and volume of work or tasks they complete. This approach ensures fair compensation and recognition for the efforts contributed to our collective goals.
