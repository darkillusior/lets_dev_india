# About project and future plans

We want to build an organization to help India develop. We plan to create a rank-based system to manage this organization, where individuals who complete more tasks will attain higher ranks. These tasks may encompass activities such as cleaning, tree planting, and solar plant construction. I understand it's a significant dream, but with collective effort, we can accomplish it

## Future Plans
### 1. Machile Learning Model
  We will be utilizing machine learning to authenticate and detect images or videos to verify the completion of tasks.
### 2. Add Map
  Additionally, we plan to incorporate a map feature to showcase real-time progress of our work to the world. This map will continually update with both old and new images, providing a dynamic visual representation of our ongoing initiatives.
### 3. Add Shop
  We intend to introduce a dedicated shop where individuals can purchase equipment specifically designed for cleaning and planting purposes. These items will be distributed based on the respective ranks achieved by participants, creating a system that rewards and supports their commitment to our initiatives
### 4.Credit System
  We are considering implementing a credit system that allows individuals to earn money based on their ranks. Alternatively, participants may receive a minimum salary commensurate with the type and volume of work or tasks they complete. This approach ensures fair compensation and recognition for the efforts contributed to our collective goals.
